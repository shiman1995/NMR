# To generate a supercell pdb file use an unit cell pdb file

1. Prepared files

1.1 An unitcell pdb file is needed. The file format follows the format of the unitcell.pdb in the example.

1.2 Set up the parameter.in file correctly.
    In the parameter.in file:
    The first line 'nxl,nyl,nzl' represent the number of cells extending along the lattice direction. (for example, 
    if nxl=2, it shows that the crystal cell will expand two cells in the negative and positive directions of a. So
    when nxl=2, nyl=2, nzl=2, it represents a 5*5*5 supercell will be built.
    The second line 'number of atoms' is the number of atoms in an unit cell.
    The third line 'Lattice constant' is the lattice constant(a, b, c) of a crystal.
    The last line 'angle' is the angle of the crystal.

2. Usage

2.1 Compile the program using the command 'make'. (Note the makefile! Be sure the command 'ifort' you can use)And then    an executable file 'supercell.x' is generated.
2.2 Execut the program. You can run the program using the command './supercell.x'. After that two files will be obtained. ('newcell.inpcrd' and 'newcell.pdb') The 'newcell.pdb' file is the supercell pdb file.

3. The format of the output file
   The default output order of pdb is from unit cell (-1,-1,-1) to (1,1,1).
