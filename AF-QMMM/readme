# To get the input file of calculation using the AF-QM/MM program.

1. Prepared files

1.1 A supercell pdb file is needed. The 'newcell.pdb' is generated by the program 'supercell.f90'from the folder 'supercell' 

1.2 The 'fitting_charge.txt' file is needed.
    The 'fitting_charge.txt' file can be obtained from the 'mol2' file of a single molecule. While the 'mole2' file can be generated by the command 'antechamber', the specific usage of the command is 'antechamber -i xx.pdb -fi pdb -o xx.mol2 -fo mol2 -c bcc -nc 0 -s 2  -pf y'('xx' is the name of the pdb file).


2. Usage

2.1 What needs attention and modification in the program.
 1) in the line 21 of the program 'afmol.f90', the 'lastprotres' is the total molecules of the supercell. Generally, if there are 'N' molecules in the unit cell and a 'm*n*l' supercell, then 'lastprotres = N*m*n*l'. (For example, there are 4 molecues in the unit cell of the crystal CIMETD, and a '5*5*5*' supercell is built, then the value of 'lastprotres' is 500.('lastprotres = 4*5*5*5')
 2) in the line 22 of the program 'afmol.f90', the 'molatom' is the number of atoms in a single molecule.
 3) in the line 23 of the program 'afmol.f90', the 'basename' is the based name of the input file, which occupies 4 characters.
 4) in the line 154 of the program 'afmol.f90', the '%mem' is the memory set in your Gaussian inputfile. You can modify it accordig to your machine.
 5) in the line 155 of the program 'afmol.f90', the '%nprocshared' is the number of cores for Gaussian calculation. You can set it according to your machine.
 6) in the line 157ï¼Œ158 of the program 'afmol.f90', the '#B3LYP/6-31g** charge nmr(printeigenvectors) nosymm &'
        'integral(grid=ultrafine)' is the key word and method using in Gaussian calculation.

2.2 Compile the program using the command 'ifort afmol.f90' or 'gfortran afmol.f90'And then an executable file 'a.out' is generated.

2.3 Execut the program. You can run the program using the command './a.out'. After that the 'lastprotres' fragments files will be obtained. ('xxx.com' and 'xxx.pqr') The 'xxx.com' file is the input file of Gaussian, while the 'xxx.pqr' is the file which records detailed information of the atoms and there coordinations.

3. Calculate the Gaussian file
   After get the files of fragments, you can only calculate the fragments in the central unit cell using the command 'g09 xxx.com'. For example, to calculate the chemical shift of the crystal CIMETD, only the fragments in the central unit cell are needed to be calculated, therefore, the command is 'g09 CITD249.com', 'g09 CITD250.com', 'g09 CITD251.com', 'g09 CITD252.com'(in total 4 fragments, for there are 4 molecules in the unit cell). Four results obtained,and then averaged to get the chemical shifts of the crystal.
